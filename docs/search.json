    "text": "Prerequisites\nBefore starting this course you will need to ensure that your computer is set up with the required software. If you have any difficulty installing any of this software then please contact one of the trainers for help.\n\nInstalling R and RStudio\nR and RStudio are separate downloads and installations.\nR is the underlying statistical computing environment. The base R system and a very large collection of packages that give you access to a huge range of statistical and analytical functionality are available from CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network.\nHowever, using R alone is no fun. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R much easier and more interactive.\n\nLocal Installation\nYou need to install R before you install RStudio.\n\n\nWindows\n\n\nIf you already have R and RStudio installed:\n\nOpen RStudio, and click on “Help” &gt; “Check for updates”. If a new version is available, quit RStudio, and download the latest version for RStudio.\nTo check which version of R you are using, start RStudio and the first thing that appears in the console indicates the version of R you are running. Alternatively, you can type sessionInfo(), which will also display which version of R you are running. Go on the CRAN website and check whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install it. You can check here for more information on how to remove old versions from your system if you wish to do so.\n\nIf you don’t have R and RStudio installed:\n\nDownload R from the CRAN website.\nRun the .exe file that was just downloaded\nGo to the RStudio download page\nUnder Installers select RStudio x.yy.zzz - Windows 10/8/7 where x, y, and z represent version numbers)\nDouble click the file to install it\nOnce it’s installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don’t get any error messages.\n\n\n\n\nmacOS\n\nIf you already have R and RStudio installed:\n\nOpen RStudio, and click on “Help” &gt; “Check for updates”. If a new version is available, quit RStudio, and download the latest version for RStudio.\nTo check the version of R you are using, start RStudio and the first thing that appears on the terminal indicates the version of R you are running. Alternatively, you can type sessionInfo(), which will also display which version of R you are running. Go on the CRAN website and check whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install it.\n\nIf you don’t have R and RStudio installed:\n\nDownload R from the CRAN website.\nSelect the .pkg file for the latest R version\nDouble click on the downloaded file to install R\nIt is also a good idea to install XQuartz (needed by some packages)\nGo to the RStudio download page\nUnder Installers select RStudio x.yy.zzz - Mac OS X 10.6+ (64-bit) (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)\nDouble click the file to install RStudio\nOnce it’s installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don’t get any error messages.\n\n\n\n\n\nLinux\n\n\nFollow the instructions for your distribution from CRAN, they provide information to get the most recent version of R for common distributions. For most distributions, you could use your package manager (e.g., for Debian/Ubuntu run sudo apt-get install r-base, and for Fedora sudo yum install R), but we don’t recommend this approach as the versions provided by this are usually out of date. In any case, make sure you have at least R 4.3.2.\nGo to the RStudio download page\nUnder Installers select the version that matches your distribution, and install it with your preferred method (e.g., with Debian/Ubuntu sudo dpkg -i   rstudio-x.yy.zzz-amd64.deb at the terminal).\nOnce it’s installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don’t get any error messages.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling R Packages\nOn this course we will be making use of a brilliant collection of packages designed for data science called the tidyverse that make it much easier and more fun to work with your data. After installing R and RStudio, follow the instructions below to install the tidyverse package suite.\n\nAfter starting RStudio, at the console type: install.packages(\"tidyverse\") (look for the ‘Console’ tab and type at the &gt; prompt)\nYou can also do this by going to Tools -&gt; Install Packages and typing the names of the packages separated by a comma."

The screenshot below shows an analogy linking the different RStudio windows to cooking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsole Pane\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the left-hand side, you’ll find the console. This is where you can input commands (code that R can interpret), and the responses to your commands, known as output, are displayed here. While the console is handy for experimenting with code, it doesn’t save any of your entered commands. Therefore, relying exclusively on the console is not recommended.\n\n\nHistory Pane\n\n\n\n\n\nThe history pane (located in the top right window) maintains a record of the commands that you have executed in the R console during your current R session. This includes both correct and incorrect commands.\nYou can navigate through your command history using the up and down arrow keys in the console. This allows you to quickly recall and re-run previous commands without retyping them.\n\n\nEnvironment Pane\n\n\n\n\n\nThe environment pane (located in the top right window) provides an overview of the objects (variables, data frames, etc.) that currently exist in your R session. It displays the names, types, dimensions, and some content of these objects. This allows you to monitor the state of your workspace in real-time.\n\n\nPlotting Pane\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plotting pane (located in the bottom right window) is where graphical output, such as plots and charts, is displayed when you create visualizations in R. The Plotting pane often includes tools for zooming, panning, and exporting plots, providing additional functionality for exploring and customizing your visualizations.\n\n\nHelp Pane\n\n\n\n\n\nThe help pane (located in the bottom right window) is a valuable resource for accessing documentation and information about R functions, packages, and commands. When you type a function or command in the console and press the F1 key (Mac: fn + F1) the Help pane displays relevant documentation. Additionally, you can type a keyword in the text box at the top right corner of the Help Pane.\n\n\nFiles Pane\n\n\n\n\n\nThe files pane provides a file browser and file management interface within RStudio. It allows you to navigate through your project directories, view files, and manage your file system.\n\n\nPackages Pane\n\n\n\n\n\nThis pane provides a user-friendly interface for managing R packages. It lists installed packages and allows you to load, unload, update, and install packages.\n\n\nViewer Pane\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is used to display dynamic content generated by R, such as HTML, Shiny applications, or interactive visualizations."

This shows you the path to your working directory in the console. In Mac this is in the format /path/to/working/directory and in Windows C:\\path\\to\\working\\directory. It is often useful to have your data and R scripts in the same directory and set this as your working directory. We will do this now.\nMake a folder for this course somewhere on your computer that you will be able to easily find. Name the folder for example, Intro_R_course. Then, to set this folder as your working directory:\nIn RStudio click on the Files tab and then click on the three dots, as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the window that appears, find the folder you created (e.g. Intro_R_course), click on it, then click Open.

    "title": "Introduction to R: Visualizing Cancer Data",
    "section": "R Packages",
    "text": "R Packages\nMany developers have built 1000s of functions and shared them with the R user community to help make everyone’s work easier and more efficient. These functions (short programs) are generally packaged up together in (wait for it) Packages. For example, the tidyverse package is a compilation of many different functions, all of which help with data transformation and visualization. Packages also contain data, which is often included to assist new users with learning the available functions.\n\nInstalling Packages\nPackages are hosted on repositories, with CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) being the primary repository. To install packages from CRAN, you use the install.packages() function. For example:\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nThis will spit out a lot of text into the console as the package is being installed. Once complete you should have a message:\nThe downloaded binary packages are in... followed by a long directory name.\nTo remove an installed package:\n\nremove.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\n\n\nLoading Packages\nAfter installation, you need to load a package into your R session using the library() function. For example:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.0     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nThis makes the functions and datasets from the ‘tidyverse’ package available for use in your current session.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou only need to install a package once. Once installed, you don’t need to reinstall it in subsequent sessions. However, you do need to load the package at the beginning of each R session using the library() function before you can utilize its functions and features. This ensures that the package is actively available for use in your current session.\n\n\nTask 2: Install and load the two packeages: readr and ggplot2.\n\n\nPackage Documentation\nEach package comes with documentation that explains how to use its functions. You can access this information using the help() function or by using ? before the function name:\n\nhelp(tidyverse)\n\n\nView Output\n\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n\n\n\nR: tidyverse: Easily Install and Load the ‘Tidyverse’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntidyverse-package\n\n\nR Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\ntidyverse: Easily Install and Load the ‘Tidyverse’\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ‘tidyverse’ is a set of packages that work in harmony because they share common data representations and ‘API’ design. This package is designed to make it easy to install and load multiple ‘tidyverse’ packages in a single step. Learn more about the ‘tidyverse’ at https://www.tidyverse.org.\n\n\nAuthor(s)\n\n\nMaintainer: Hadley Wickham hadley@rstudio.com\n\n\nOther contributors:\n\n\n\n\nRStudio [copyright holder, funder]\n\n\n\n\nSee Also\n\n\nUseful links:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://tidyverse.tidyverse.org\n\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse\n\n\n\n\nReport bugs at https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse/issues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 3: Display the documentation of readr package."

    "text": "Building a Basic Plot\nThe construction of ggplot graphics is incremental, allowing for the addition of new elements in layers. This approach grants users extensive flexibility and customization options, enabling the creation of tailored plots to suit specific needs.\n\nTo build a ggplot, the following basic template can be used for different types of plots.\n Three things are required for a ggplot:\n\n1. The data\nWe first specify the data frame that contains the relevant data to create a plot. Here we are sending the metabric dataset to the ggplot() function.\n\n# render plot background\nggplot(data = metabric)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command results in an empty gray panel. We must specify how various columns of the data frame should be depicted in the plot.\n\n\n2. Aesthetics aes()\nNext, we specify the columns in the data we want to map to visual properties (called aesthetics or aes in ggplot2). e.g. the columns for x values, y values and colours.\nSince we are interested in generating a scatter plot, each point will have an x and a y coordinate. Therefore, we need to specify the x-axis to represent the transcription factor (GATA3) and y-axis to represent the estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1).\n\nggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = GATA3, y = ESR1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis results in a plot which includes the grid lines, the variables and the scales for x and y axes. However, the plot is empty or lacks data points.\n\n\n3. Geometric Representation geom_()\nFinally, we specify the type of plot (the geom). There are different types of geoms:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_blank() draws an empty plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_segment() draws a straight line. geom_vline() draws a vertical line and geom_hline() draws a horizontal line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_curve() draws a curved line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_line()/geom_path() makes a line plot. geom_line() connects points from left to right and geom_path() connects points in the order they appear in the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_point() produces a scatterplot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_jitter() adds a small amount of random noise to the points in a scatter plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_dotplot() produces a dot plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_smooth() adds a smooth trend line to a plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_quantile() draws fitted quantile with lines (a scatter plot with regressed quantiles).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_density() creates a density plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_histogram() produces a histogram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_bar() makes a bar chart. Height of the bar is proportional to the number of cases in each group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_col() makes a bar chart. Height of the bar is proportional to the values in data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_boxplot() produces a box plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_violin() creates a violin plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_ribbon() produces a ribbon (y interval defined line).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_area() draws an area plot, which is a line plot filled to the y-axis (filled lines).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_rect(), geom_tile() and geom_raster() draw rectangles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_polygon() draws polygons, which are filled paths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_text() adds text to a plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_text() adds label to a plot.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe range of geoms available in ggplot2 can be obtained by navigating to the ggplot2 package in the Packages tab pane in RStudio (bottom right-hand corner) and scrolling down the list of functions sorted alphabetically to the geom_... functions.\nSince we are interested in creating a scatter plot, the geometric representation of the data will be in point form. Therefore we use the geom_point() function.\nTo plot the expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) against that of the transcription factor, GATA3:\n\nggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = GATA3, y = ESR1)) + geom_point() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that we use the + sign to add a layer of points to the plot. This concept bears resemblance to Adobe Photoshop, where layers of images can be rearranged and edited independently. In ggplot, each layer is added over the plot in accordance with its position in the code using the + sign."

    "text": "Customizing Plots\n\nAdding Colour\nThe above plot could be made more informative. For instance, the additional information regarding the ER status (i.e., ER_status column) could be incorporated into the plot. To do this, we can utilize aes() and specify which column in the metabric data frame should be represented as the color of the points.\n\nggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = GATA3, y = ESR1, colour)) +\n    geom_point(mapping = aes(colour = ER_status)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that we specify the colour = ER_status argument in the aes() mapping inside the geom_() function instead of ggplot() function.\nTo colour points based on a continuous variable, for example: Nottingham prognostic index (NPI):\n\nggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = GATA3, y = ESR1)) +\n  geom_point(aes(colour = Neoplasm_histologic_grade)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn ggplot2, a color scale is used for continuous variables, while discrete or categorical values are represented using discrete colors.\nNote that some patient samples lack expression values, leading ggplot2 to remove those points with missing values for ESR1 and GATA3.\n\n\nAdding Shape\nLet’s add shape to points.\n\nggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = GATA3, y = ESR1)) + \n  geom_point(mapping = aes(shape = `3-gene_classifier`))\n\nWarning: Removed 204 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that some patient samples have not been classified and ggplot has removed those points with missing values for the three-gene classifier.\nThe shape argument allows you to customize the appearance of all data points by assigning an integer associated with predefined shapes shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use asterix instead of points in the plot:\n\nggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = GATA3, y = ESR1)) + \n  geom_point(shape = 8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would be useful to be able to change the shape of all the points. We can do so by setting the size to a single value rather than mapping it to one of the variables in the data set - this has to be done outside the aesthetic mappings (i.e. outside the aes() bit) as above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAesthetic Setting vs. Mapping\n\n\n\nInstead of mapping an aesthetic property to a variable, you can set it to a single value by specifying it in the layer parameters (outside aes()).

Consequently, adapting to changes in the data or transitioning between plot types requires only minimal modifications. This feature facilitates the creation of high-quality plots suitable for publication with minimal manual adjustments.\n\nReading the Data\nIn this section, you’ll learn the basics of reading data files into R using the readr package. We will use the read_csv() function from readr package to import a dataset. CSV short for Comma Separated Values, is a text format commonly used to store tabular data.

Aesthetics aes()\nNext, we specify the columns in the data we want to map to visual properties (called aesthetics or aes in ggplot2). e.g. the columns for x values, y values and colours.\nSince we are interested in generating a scatter plot, each point will have an x and a y coordinate. Therefore, we need to specify the x-axis to represent the transcription factor (GATA3) and y-axis to represent the estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1).\nThis results in a plot which includes the grid lines, the variables and the scales for x and y axes. However, the plot is empty or lacks data points.\n\n\n3. Geometric Representation geom_()\nSince we are interested in creating a scatter plot, the geometric representation of the data will be in point form. Therefore we use the geom_point() function.\nTo plot the expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) against that of the transcription factor, GATA3:\nNotice that we use the + sign to add a layer of points to the plot. This concept bears resemblance to Adobe Photoshop, where layers of images can be rearranged and edited independently. In ggplot, each layer is added over the plot in accordance with its position in the code using the + sign."

To do this, we can utilize aes() and specify which column in the metabric data frame should be represented as the color of the points.\nNotice that we specify the colour = ER_status argument in the aes() mapping inside the geom_() function instead of ggplot() function.\nTo colour points based on a continuous variable, for example: Nottingham prognostic index (NPI):\nIn ggplot2, a color scale is used for continuous variables, while discrete or categorical values are represented using discrete colors.\nNote that some patient samples lack expression values, leading ggplot2 to remove those points with missing values for ESR1 and GATA3.\n\n\nAdding Shape\nLet’s add shape to points.\nNote that some patient samples have not been classified and ggplot has removed those points with missing values for the three-gene classifier.\nTo use asterix instead of points in the plot:\nIt would be useful to be able to change the shape of all the points.
